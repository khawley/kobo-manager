# Kobo File and DB Manager

## Purpose

To be able to remove damaged, large or old books from my Kobo ereader device programmatically.  As my Kobo (Kobo Wifi) only has a D-pad and poor software interface, I wanted more efficiency and accuracy.  (Similarly, the Desktop app doesn't seem to communicate with it well about deleting things either.)
